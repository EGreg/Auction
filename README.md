# Cross-chain Auction

Cross-Chain Auction is a decentralized platform enabling users to create and participate in auctions across multiple blockchain networks. This project was developed as part of the BNB Hack 2024 Q4.


## About

- ðŸŽ¨ **Flexible Payment Options**: Allows bidders to participate using various tokens across different chains, accommodating diverse preferences and increasing bidder participation.
- ðŸ”— **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Supports multiple blockchain networks, enabling seamless interaction between different ecosystems and broadening the auction's reach.
- ðŸ’³ **Credit Card Integration**: Plans to incorporate traditional payment methods like credit cards, providing accessibility to non-crypto users and expanding the potential bidder base.
- ðŸ’° **Maximized Revenue**: By accepting a wide range of payment methods, the auction platform reduces barriers to entry, potentially increasing the number of participants and the final bid amounts.

## Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Facilitates auctions across various blockchain networks, enhancing interoperability.
- **Decentralized Auctions**: Empowers users to create and manage auctions without centralized intermediaries.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Utilizes smart contracts to ensure transparent and secure auction processes.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.x or higher)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (for Ethereum development)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EGreg/Auction.git
   cd Auction


## Description

The **Cross-chain Auction** project is a platform for cross-chain auctions. The main idea is to create a single smart contract that allows users to participate in auctions across multiple blockchains.

Features:
- Create auctions via smart contracts.
- Support for interaction across multiple blockchains.
- Automatic bid management and synchronization of data between networks.

## Technologies

- **Solidity**: smart contract implementation.
- **Hardhat**: toolkit for testing and deploying contracts.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Ethers.js)**: for the frontend.

## Installation

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artman325/Auction.git
   cd Auction
   ```
2. Install Hardhat dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up a local HTTP server to serve the HTML files. For example:
   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   ```

## Usage

### Page Structure:
1. **produce.html**:
   - Form to create an auction. Users can specify parameters such as:
     - Token address (`token`).
     - Number of winners.
     - Time settings (`startTime`, `endTime`).
     - Starting price (`startingPrice`) and price increment step.

2. **produce.js**:
   - Script for blockchain interaction. Includes:
     - MetaMask integration.
     - Network switching and contract calls.
     - User interface management.

### Auction Workflow:
- After creating an auction via **produce.html**, the auction data is synchronized across blockchains.
- Users can place bids on any supported blockchain.
- Once the auction ends, winners can claim their NFTs using the corresponding buttons in the interface.

## Key Files

- `Auction.sol`: main auction contract.
- `AuctionFactory.sol`: factory contract for creating new auctions.
- `IAuction.sol`, `IAuctionFactory.sol`: interfaces for the contracts.
- `produce.html`, `produce.js`: user interaction interface.
